# Simple Terminal Voice Recorder

A lightweight, terminal-based voice recorder written in Python with **pause/resume**, **live preview**, **trash/recycle bin**, quality presets and basic file management — no GUI, no bloat.

## Features

- Real-time recording with **pause / resume**
- Listen to what you've just recorded (**preview**) without saving
- Three quality presets:  
  • High — 48 kHz stereo  
  • Medium — 44.1 kHz stereo (default)  
  • Low — 44.1 kHz mono
- Save with automatic timestamp or custom name
- recordings/ folder + trash/ (recycle bin) system
- Move to trash / restore / permanent delete
- Sort recordings by date / name / duration
- Rename, play, delete from list view
- Clean terminal interface using ANSI
- Graceful Ctrl+C handling (asks to save before exit)
